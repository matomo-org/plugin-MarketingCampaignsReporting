### The Marketing URL Builder

[Generate your trackable marketing URLs with our URL Builder tool.](https://matomo.org/docs/tracking-campaigns-url-builder/)

### Tracking campaigns

To track a campaign, you add special URL parameters to your URLs.

The URL parameters are:

* `mtm_campaign` (campaign name such as mailing_2017_03 or Easter_Sale), 
* `mtm_source` (campaign source such as google or facebook), 
* `mtm_medium` (campaign medium such as email or cpc), 
* `mtm_keyword` (campaign keyword), 
* `mtm_content` (campaign content),
* `mtm_cid` (campaign ID code).
* `mtm_group` (campaign group).
* `mtm_placement` (campaign placement).

If you already have URLs tagged with Google Analytics parameters these are also supported: 

* `utm_campaign`, 
* `utm_source`, 
* `utm_medium`, 
* `utm_term`, 
* `utm_content`,
* `utm_id`.

For example if your Ad URL or landing page URL is `example.com/offer`, you would track all clicks on this URL by 
adding one or more of the parameters above: 
```
example.com/offer?mtm_campaign=Best-Seller&mtm_source=Newsletter_7&mtm_medium=email
```

### Features
 * Real time Analytics Reports of all your Campaign Marketing.
 * Detects Campaign parameters from the landing page URL, within the query string or in the #hash string.
 * The Referrers>Overview report displays a left column "Referrers Overview" with a list of reports that can be loaded on click.
   This report viewer now also lists the new Campaign reports under "View Referrers by Campaign".
 * The content of Referrers> Campaign will be replaced with the new enhanced Campaigns reports.
 * The default Referrers Campaign widget and API are working as before.
 * The campaign reports are available in Matomo Mobile and can be sent as Scheduled reports (by email, as HTML or PDF).
 * Segment editor: a new "Campaigns" category lists the five new segment for each campaign dimension (campaign name, campaign keyword, campaign source, campaign medium, campaign content).
 * Add Marketing campaign reports to your personalized Dashboard.
 * Access the Campaign Report data with the Marketing Campaigns Reporting API.
 * Will track up to 250 characters for each of the five Campaign dimension.
 * Get automatic [email and sms reports](https://matomo.org/docs/email-reports/) for your campaigns, or send them to your colleagues or customers. 

### Reports for more than 1,000 campaigns

In the Campaign reports by default Matomo will only archive the first 1000 rows (your 1000 most popular campaigns). 
To report on all your campaigns you can configure Matomo so it does not truncate your data. 
For example to keep the top 10,000 campaigns edit your `config/config.ini.php` and add the following:

```
[General]
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_referrers = 10000
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_subtable_referrers = 10000
```

### Customising your campaign parameters 

It is possible to configure custom names for campaign parameters. In order to do so you have add config to config.ini.php file.
If you configure any campaign parameter this configuration will overwrite default config for this parameter.

```
[MarketingCampaignsReporting]
campaign_name = "matomo_campaign,mtm_cpn,utm_campaign"
campaign_keyword = "mtm_keyword,matomo_kwd,mtm_kwd,utm_term"
campaign_source = "mtm_source,utm_source"
campaign_medium = "mtm_medium,utm_medium"
campaign_content = "mtm_content,utm_content"
campaign_id = "mtm_cid,utm_id,mtm_clid"
campaign_group = "mtm_group"
campaign_placement = "mtm_placement"
```

For example, by default parameter `campaign_name` track following parameters if they are found in URL: `'mtm_campaign', 'matomo_campaign', 'mtm_cpn', 'utm_campaign'`. If you configure `campaign_name` like this `campaign_name="mtm_campaign,custom_name_parameter"`, then parameter `campaign_name` will detect only presence of `mtm_campaign` and `custom_name_parameter` in URL. `matomo_campaign`, `mtm_cpn`, `utm_campaign` will be ignored until they are present in config.
All parameter are case-insensitiv except optional mtm_clid.
